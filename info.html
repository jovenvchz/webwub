          why did I make this for her?<br /><br />

          Angel is my <b>greatest love. </b> <br />
          She is my <b>best friend.</b> <br />
          She is the <b> most adorable person ever</b>!
          <br />
          She is <b>the one i want to be with</b>, <br />and she is the one
          <b>I want to love for the rest of my life</b>. <br /><br />
